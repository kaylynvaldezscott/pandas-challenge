Summary Description:
At the top of the notebook, you will find a personal analysis breaking down results in certain areas of the research. I draw connections between overall District data, as well as smaller more focused individual data on certain schools. In each cell, you will find the task/question, and the output as the answer. 

There are two sections to investigate. 

District Summary- which looks at all information from a wider lens. This allows the researcher to see how schools are developing by the area/district they are in. We are able to calculate overall student population, overall budget, and the passing rates of students in the entire district. 

School Summary - allows the researcher to take a closer look at the performance of individual schools. Using this method, we are able to compare results and see how schools are reaching success, and what can maybe be implemented to the schools that are ranking at the bottom. In this section, we examine the types of schools, the budget, and individual student success compared to other schools. 


By the end, you will be able to read my independent analysis of the data and understand specific correlations between things like school size, type, and their connection to success rate.
